Cat and Robot in Space.

Cat and Robot travel through space exporing the universe around them in their amazing solar-powered space craft. When they're not keeping the aquaponic system running smooth or hanging out with their fish friend Jerry, you'll find them oogling the stars, planets, and astro-mazing features of the cosmos out of their windows.

## Library
